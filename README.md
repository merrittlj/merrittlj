# Introduction
Hello, I'm Lucas Merritt. I'm a nearly fully self-taught aspiring software developer, with skills and experience in a variety of fields and tools.

I'm looking for interships or opportunities to challenge and apply my knowledge and gain real-world experience.

# Table of contents
TODO

I have done varied work in many categories, interests, languages, etc. I mainly try to specialize in a few topics, but I do have expansive general knowledge. Here is a simple breakdown of my experience with various technologies, on various levels:

### Disregarding the below experience, I am able to adapt, learn, and effectively utilize technologies and topics for your projects that may be out of the scope below.

# Skills and experience
This list is not all-inclusive, it is simply to give a general idea of my experience in a visual way.
## Highest experience
I most likely have multiple years of experience with them, and am generally well-versed and ready to utilize them immediately.

</div>
Notes: I am not fully familiar with all aspects of C++, as it is a large language, but feel competent for many tasks in it.

## Medium experience
I can use these technologies effectively generally, but do not know them well enough for many intricacies and have not fully dived deep into them.

## Others
I have used many other technologies, languages, and such throughout my time, but they are not as notable as those mentioned above. While these may not exactly fit what you are looking for, as I have mentioned earlier, I am adaptable to your scenario and your requirements.

# Projects
Below are some of my most notable projects, which include summaries and further details:

## Salamander
[Project Page](https://github.com/merrittlj/salamander)

This is a highly-developed 3D real-time renderer, based in Vulkan and C++.
<h1 align="center">
    <br>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/merrittlj/merrittlj/master/assets/salamander-snapshot.png" alt="Project Snapshot" height="350">
    <br>
</h1>
On a simple level, this project utilizes Vulkan, a low-level graphics library for high performance real-time graphics applications, commonly used throughout the game engine industry and for other graphics related software.

While this project may be inherently graphics oriented, this put into practice crucial technologies and skills, such as C++ and build systems(CMake), library integration, data parsing and modeling, and proper project management.

This is one of my largest projects, which I have been working on for around a year at the time of writing. Due to the large scale of the project(110 commits at the time of writing, ~5-10k lines), a key focus has been maintainability, implementation of features, and project-wide standards and coding practices.

Practically, this is a standalone renderer, which I have not attempted to integrate with other projects yet. This is not intended to do such, however, as this is mainly a learning and portfolio project.

## brawlhalla-bot
[Project Page](https://github.com/merrittlj/brawlhalla-bot)

This is an automation "bot" for the game Brawlhalla, based in Python.
<h1 align="center">
    <br>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/merrittlj/merrittlj/master/assets/brawlhalla-snapshot.png" alt="Project Snapshot" height="350">
    <br>
</h1>
This is one of my most recent endeavors, with an emphasis on object-oriented design and ease of implementation for features. In practice, this uses pixel-matching and other factors to determine what state in the game the "bot" is, and act accordingly. This does not utilize any memory-related procedures.

## rasterizer
[Project Page](https://github.com/merrittlj/rasterizer)

This is a more advanced project graphics and code-wise in comparison to my [raytracer](https://github.com/merrittlj/raytracer) project, utilizing rasterization techniques found commonly in real-time rendering.
<h1 align="center">
    <br>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/merrittlj/merrittlj/master/assets/rasterizer-snapshot.png" alt="Project Snapshot" height="350">
    <br>
</h1>
This mainly incorporates key graphics-related techniques in a very fundamental matter, from scratch without any external libraries.

## Bamboozled
[Project Page](https://github.com/merrittlj/bamboozled)

This is a very old project(4 years ago, as of writing), tracked within git and developed for multiple months somewhere around 2020. This may not be entirely accurate, however, as I am not sure how early on I started utilizing version control.

<h1 align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/merrittlj/merrittlj/master/assets/bamboozled.png" alt="Itch.io Page Snapshot" height="350">
    <br>
</h1>

Despite being an ancient project, this incorporated time-based items and inventory systems, upgrade paths, and more. The code found here is not exactly a true representation of my abilities in the present, but it is worth mentioning.

## External work
I have contributed extensively to an open source Linux project, [bemenu](). This was a real-world experience with managing code within an external project design, workflow, etc. Some of my pull request contributions can be found [here](https://github.com/Cloudef/bemenu/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amerrittlj).

In addition, I have developed a considerable web-oriented application from scratch in JavaScript recently, which uses a "serverless"(in the sense of client-side oriented) method for data transfer and building. This was work done for a client, so out of respect for them, the code and further details will not be shared.

## Honorable mentions
These projects are nearly all abandoned and are no longer being developed, but do serve some practical purpose.

* [NotEnoughBazaar](https://github.com/merrittlj/NotEnoughBazaar): A simple Minecraft mod that tracks good economic "flips" or deals for money-making in the game Hypixel Skyblock. Written in Java with Forge interaction.
* [CubeTimer](https://github.com/merrittlj/CubeTimer): A very low-level embedded program intended to track Rubik's cube times via a segmented display. Written in C.
* [Sharpshooter](https://github.com/merrittlj/SharpshooterApps): A Minecraft "name sniper", which essentially resulted in simply sending a name change request at a certain time(to "snipe"/get a name before everyone else).
* [emacs.d](https://github.com/merrittlj/emacs.d), [scripts](https://github.com/merrittlj/scripts), and [dotfiles](https://github.com/merrittlj/dotfiles): Includes various scripts, configuration files, etc. for my system.
